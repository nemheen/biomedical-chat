A) hydroxyapatite

B) collagen

C) hydroxyapatite and collagen have the same toughness","Context:
              Bone is a biological material with exceptionally high fracture toughness, combining a mineral phase of hydroxyapatite and an organic phase of collagen fibers. This composite microstructure allows bone to resist crack propagation effectively. Alumina and polyurethane are synthetic materials with different toughness properties.
The bone matrix is mainly composed of hydroxyapatite (HA) and collagen (Col). HA accounts for ~40%–45% of the volume of the bone matrix, and Col accounts for ~55%–60%14. Among them, HA has high strength, and Col ﬁbers have strong toughness14. As a natural biomaterial, the bone matrix achieves both strength and toughness because of its complex multilevel structure from the nanoto macroscale4. This complex multiscale structure and the biomechanical properties of the bone matrix provide a model for the
Bone and nacre are the most-known biological hard tissues to materials researchers.

"When impacting horns of species like pronghorn, domestic sheep, mountain goat, and bighorn sheep, which loading direction exhibits the highest toughness?

A) radial (perpendicular to the tubules)

B) longitudinal (parallel to the tubules)

C) transverse","Context:
              Impact testing of horns from species such as pronghorn, domestic sheep, mountain goats, and bighorn sheep reveals that loading direction relative to horn microstructure significantly affects toughness. Horns have tubule-like microstructures aligned longitudinally, but the highest toughness occurs under radial loading, which is perpendicular to the tubules. This orientation promotes energy dissipation mechanisms like crack deflection and microcracking, enhancing toughness compared to longitudinal or
Animal horns play an important role during intraspecific combat. This work investigates the microstructure and mechanical properties of horns from four representative ruminant species: the bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), domestic sheep (Ovis aries), mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) and pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), aiming to understand the relation between evolved microstructures and mechanical properties. Microstructural similarity is found where disc-shaped keratin cells attach edge-to-edge along
lamellae and the shape of keratin cells. Water absorption tests reveal that the pronghorn horn has the largest water-absorbing ability due to the presence of nanopores in the keratin cells. The loading direction (compressive and tensile) and level of hydration vary among the horns from different species. The differences in mechanical properties among species may relate to their different fighting behaviours: high stiffness and strength in mountain goat to support the forces during stabbing; high tensile

A) High compressive strength

B) High tensile strength

C) Small aspect ratio","Context:
              Introduction Silk exhibits exceptional properties, such as strength, toughness, elasticity and robustness, which cause it to surpass other biological and engineering materials . Indeed, for millions of years, silk’s properties have been tuned to carry out specific functions. In the case of spider webs, it provides protection, housing and a tool for prey foraging . Silk’s mechanical properties derive from its hierarchical structure, which ranges from its protein sequence to macroscale material architectures
Spider silk is renowned for its exceptional tensile strength, which can reach values around 1.2 GPa. This strength arises from the protein fibroin’s hierarchical organization into crystalline β-sheet nanocrystals within an amorphous matrix.

To assess the effects of the cytoskeleton on biomechanical properties of pulmonary EC, AFM measurements on live EC were performed before and after stimulation with thrombin and S1P. The distributions of elastic moduli (indicative of cellular resistance to the AFM probe) from the cell center to the EC periphery are analyzed in scrambled, control siRNA-transfected EC, as well as c-Abl-silenced EC. Elastic values obtained at the cell

The distribution of elasticity in live endothelium can be determined dynamically over time with AFM force mapping. Mechanical resistance to the AFM cantilever correlates with the rigidity of the actin cytoskeleton and other structural elements, and the cellular elasticity is determined by actomyosin interaction and actin stress fiber crosslinking. Actin determines the mechanical properties of

C) higher humidity causes no change","Context:
              characteristics of the stratum corneum to environmental conditions, particularly relative humidity, is well established and references therein. This phenomenon results in significant intra-sample variability of its mechanical properties. Typically, the Young’s modulus of the stratum corneum decreases with relative humidity because of the water-induced plasticisation effect affecting its “brick and mortar” structure. Moreover, differences in experimental measurement techniques, testing conditions, inter-and
Keratinous materials such as horse hooves and sheep horns exhibit significant changes in mechanical properties with moisture content. Wet samples demonstrate increased ductility and toughness compared to their dry counterparts, which tend to be more brittle. This hydration-dependent behavior is crucial for understanding their biological function and durability.
the detached silk subject to load has little intrinsic stiffness, and the subsequent strain results in deviation from the optimal angle – the upward pulling of the thread can only increase the local peeling angle. This effect is amplified for stiff silks, where the difference in stiffness changes dramatically with strain. For the previous nonlinear model, the effect was negated by the initial silk stiffness prior to yield – the detaching segments are intrinsically stiffer than the free thread. In both

The results show a decrease in the hardness as the location changes from the tip to the root of the beak for the rhamphotheca. The bony layer did not show a change with respect to location. The nanohardness was measured as 0.40+0.08 GPa for the rhamphotheca, 0.24+0.14 GPa for the foam layer and 1.16+0.19 GPa for the bony layer (table 1).

"What do sap channels in tree wood provide mechanically?

A) Sap channels have no mechanical purpose

C) Sap channels increase crack propagation leading to sooner failure","Context:
              Sap channels (vessels and tracheids) in tree wood serve primarily for fluid transport but also influence mechanical properties. Studies demonstrate that sap channels can arrest or deflect crack propagation, acting as microstructural barriers that increase toughness and delay catastrophic failure under mechanical loading.

The ﬁbres will slightly rotate under stress as a result of the microﬁbril angle arrangement of the S2 layer. This puts the lignin-rich CML under shear stress, and the rubbery nature of the lignin dissipates the stress energy.
